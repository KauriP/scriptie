*Scriptie* is a small Typst template to create standard format movie scripts.
It has title pages, scene loglines, action, dialogue, parentheticals, transitions and more.

In addition, Scriptie optionally features a hackish abuse of Typst's numbered and unnumbered lists and headings for a very efficient screenwriting experience.

```typst
#import "@preview/scriptie:0.1.0":*
#show quick_script

= INT. TYPST UNIVERSE - RIGHT NOW.

A curious Typst user is checking out the Scriptie template.

/ USER: (amazed) Wow! This is really great!

The user writes the best screenplay the world has ever seen.

/ PRODUCER: Ahh... but I don't want to produce good films.

/ USER (V.O.): Well, at least it was a joy to write.
  
- THE END.
